The simplest version of the game Blackjack.

Written as part of a study of object-oriented programming (OOP).

Introduced in the version:
1. Correct calculation when there are several aces in the hand and the sum of cards is more than 21;
2. Dealer gets cards up to 17.
3. Correct blackjack ranking (with a two-card hand) and a set of 21 (with a hand of three or more cards).

P.S.:
Implemented the game without the split, insurance and other things casinos, as the project training and the task was to 
implement a simple version is absolutely free and just get fun from it.
